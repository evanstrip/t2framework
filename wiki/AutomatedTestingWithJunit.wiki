= Automated Testing with JUnit =

by Wishnu Prasetya

Yes, you can do automated testing with JUnit! You need to download my[http://code.google.com/p/t2framework/ T2 utility] first. T2 is a powerful automated testing utility for Java. It is a free sowftware.

Download T2 jar first, and put it somewhere. We will use it as a normal Java library.

Let's consider the example below. It's a simple class that provides sorted lists.

{{{
public class SortedList {

    private LinkedList<Comparable> s ;   // this will hold the list
    private Comparable max ;             // direct pointer to the largest element

    /**
     * A constructor to make an empty list.
     */
    public SortedList() { s = new LinkedList<Comparable>() ; }

    /**
     * Insert x into the list; maintain the list sorted, and relink max
     * accordingly.
     */
    public void insert(Comparable x) { ... }

    /**
     * Retrieve the max-element from the list. 
     */
    public Comparable get() { ... }
}
}}}
