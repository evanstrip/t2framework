#A tutorial for basic use of Javadoc

Javadoc is a standard tool that allows you to generate HTML documentation of your Java programs. All you need to do is to write your comments in your programs, then you run javadoc to generate your HTML docs. However you must write your documentation in a certain way. Here is an example:

{{{


	/**
	 * You can add a description of a public attribute, by documenting it above the
	 * attribute, as we did now.
	 * 
	 * <p>This is the name of this person</p>.
	 */
	public String name ;
	
	/**
	 * This is this person's set of friends.
	 */
	public Set<Person> friends ;
	
	/**
	 * In the same way, you can add a description of a public method or constructor.
	 * 
	 * <p>This will create a person with the given name, and an empty set of friends.</p>
	 */
	public Person(String n) {
		name = n ; friends = new HashSet<Person>() ;
	}
	
	/**
	 * This will return true if this person has no friend.
	 */
	boolean isLonely() { return friends.isEmpty() ; }
	
	/**
	 * You can also describe what each parameter is, as below. You can also describe
	 * the return value.
	 * 
	 * <p>This method is used to add a friend to this person, if the person is not a
	 * friend already.</p>
	 * 
	 * @param p The person to be added as a friend.
	 * @return  True if p is new a friend; else false.
	 */
	boolean addFriend(Person p) { 
		if (friends.contains(p)) return false ;
		friends.add(p) ; 
		return true ;
	}
	
}
