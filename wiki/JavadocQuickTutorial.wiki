= A tutorial for basic use of Javadoc =

Javadoc is a standard tool that allows you to generate HTML documentation of your Java programs. All you need to do is to write your comments in your programs, then you run javadoc to generate your HTML docs. However you must write your documentation in a certain way. Here is an example:

{{{
import java.util.*;

/**
 * You can describe your class here, by adding this kind of comment right
 * above your class declaration. You can also use HTML tags in your 
 * documentation, as shown below.
 *
 * <p>An object of this class represents a person, which may have <i>friends</i>.
 * </p>
 * 
 */
public class Person {

    /**
     * You can add a description of a public attribute, by documenting it above the
     * attribute, as we did now.
     * 
     * <p>This is the name of this person</p>.
     */
    public String name ;
    
    /**
     * This is this person's set of friends.
     */
    public Set<Person> friends ;
    
    /**
     * In the same way, you can add a description of a public method or constructor.
     * 
     * <p>This will create a person with the given name, and an empty set of friends.</p>
     */
    public Person(String n) {
            name = n ; friends = new HashSet<Person>() ;
    }
    
    /**
     * This will return true if this person has no friend.
     */
    boolean isLonely() { return friends.isEmpty() ; }
    
    /**
     * You can also describe what each parameter is, as below. You can also describe
     * the return value.
     * 
     * <p>This method is used to add a friend to this person, if the person is not a
     * friend already.</p>
     * 
     * @param p The person to be added as a friend.
     * @return  True if p is new a friend; else false.
     */
    boolean addFriend(Person p) { 
            if (friends.contains(p)) return false ;
            friends.add(p) ; 
            return true ;
    }
}
}}}

To run javadoc you will need to have it. It should already be included in your Java, and the path to it should already be included in your system. So, to run it you need to do something like this from your *console*:

{{{
javadoc -d mydocs src\*.java
}}}

where `mydocs` is the directory where you want to put the generated HTML documentations; `src` is the directory where you put your java files. The above command will generate HTML documentation of all Java files in `src`.

However the above command does not generate documentation for the Java classes which are within a package. To generate the documentation of an entire package do something like this:

{{{
javadoc -d mydocs -sourcepath src MyPackage
}}}  


=== Using Javadoc from Eclipse ===

Very easy. Use the menu item: Project > Generate javadoc

You will get an window where you can specify which classes and packages you want to pass to Javadoc. You may need to specify somewhere in that window a path to your javadoc program. Then you can click on ok/finish button.
